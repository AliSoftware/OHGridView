This class allows you to display a grid of views.
Its API is very similar to the API of UITableView : it can reuses/recycle cells to avoid too much allocations and it uses tiling to avoid having a too big memory footprint.

You can configure its properties like rowHeight, columnCount, É

Then, to use it, you simply have to implement the methods of the GridViewDataSource protocol, like you would do for a UITableView:
-(NSUInteger)numberOfItemsInGridView:(GridView *)aGridView;
-(GridViewCell*)gridView:(GridView *)aGridView cellAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath;

You can also implement the GridViewDelegate protocol especially to handle when a cell is tapped:
-(void)gridView:(GridView *)aGridView didSelectCellAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath;


See the "GridViewExample" project for a basic usage example (including changing the number of columns used when the iPhone orientation changes)
